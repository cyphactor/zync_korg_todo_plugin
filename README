Configuration
-------------
The configuration for this plugin should exist in a Config file which should
exist in ones home directory. The Config file should be named
.KOrgTodoPlugin.conf. The Config file can contain any of the following entries:

korg_cal_path=<path to KOrganizer calender file to synchronize with>
korg_conf_path=<path to KOrganizer config file>

There should NOT be any spaces between the equals sign and the path or the
item title. The default path for the standard KOrganizer calendar is as
follows:

<user home directory>/.kde/share/apps/korganizer/std.ics

The default path for the KOrganizer config file is as follows:

<user home directory>/.kde/share/config/korganizerrc

Note: This plugin does not interpret the ~ as the current users home
directory. You must provide the full path name.

An example configuration file has been provided within this directory called
example.KOrgTodoPlugin.conf. One could use the example Config by doing the
following:

> cp example.KOrgTodoPlugin.conf ~/.KOrgTodoPlugin.conf

Open ~/.KOrgTodoPlugin.conf in your favorite text editor and replace the
<user-home-dir> with their actual home directory.

Performing the above operations will configure the plugin to use the standard
KOrganizer calendar file and standard KOrganizer config. If you would like to
synchronize with a different KOrganizer calendar file please change the value
of the korg_cal_path item in the Config file.
