	* Removed the ConfigManagerType class from the source as well as
	its DebugControl header since they are now provided by the confmgr
	library included with zync. This makes the plugin only consist of
	two source files now and makes it quite a bit cleaner.

--- 1.0.2 Released

	* Changed the PLUGIN_VERSION define to TODO_PLUGIN_VERSION so it
	won't duplicated defines when loading multiple plugins.

	* Went through and made the code base a little more robust.
	
	* Implemented Single Action Full Sync.
	
	* Fixed a problem with the plugin detecting deletions.
	
	* Switched the KOrganizer interface code to now use the
	CalendarLocal class rather than the CalendarResource class. Since
	the .KOrgTodoPlugin.conf file was going to end up being required
	for people that are not running KDE. Beyond that, this method
	works for both people running KDE as well as those who are not.

	* Switched the KOrganizer interface code to now use the
	CalendarResources class rather than the CalendarLocal class. This
	eliminates the need for the .KOrgTodoPlugin.conf file as well as
	fixes the segfault problems that were occuring in single action
	Full Sync before.

	* Added robustness so that it no longer crashes when reading a
	malformed .KOrgTodoPlugin.log file. It now also handles all
	deleted items which it detected even if there was an error in
	reading from the .KOrgTodoPlugin.log. The items that are not able
	to be read from the .KOrgTodoPlugin.log are not checked to see if
	they have been deleted.
